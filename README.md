# Cluster-Analysis-on-loan-data

This project aims to cluster individuals based on historical loan data using both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods.

By classifying individuals according to their financial history, the project predicts whether they are likely to repay the loan on time or default. This information helps banks make informed decisions about granting loan amounts.
